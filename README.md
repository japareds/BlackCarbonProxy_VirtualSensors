# Black Carbon Proxy using virtual sensors.
Using graph-based virtual sensors to create a Black Carbon proxy.

Black carbon is indirectly measured via other predictors: NOx, O3, PMx, UFP, meteorological variables, among others.
A genetic algorithm is used to determine a subset of optimal predictors.

The results of the reference station data set, obtained through a high-end reliable but expensive device is compared against graph-based virtual sensors.
